# TextEase
I developed a text editor and writer entirely in C++. The application features a 2D linked list each node containing four pointers for text management, supports cursor navigation, insertion, deletion, and undo/redo functionality, and includes file handling. It demonstrates robust data structures and efficient memory management.
